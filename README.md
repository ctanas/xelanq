# XElanQ
Python script for creating a CSV file from an output (*.rep* files) generated by the software of Perkin Elmer Elan DRC II Inductively Coupled  Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)

## How to use
This is a Python3 script, so you should have Python3 installed before attempting to use this.
Simply run in your prefered terminal or command line:
    
    python3 xelanq

and you should have an output.csv files with the result in the current directory. Tested on Linux, Windows 10 and macOS. The script needs a proper *tq.rep* file in the current directory, as input.

## Version 0.1 (Tarsus IV) - initial release (21.02.2018)
*Functional, but limited*

This is more like a proof-of-concept. The script reads the *.rep* file and outputs a (proper) CSV file, with all the samples ordered in columns, with element concentration on each line. Only works for (my) TotalQuant report files, but support for quantitative reports is planned in future versions.

## TODO
- Scan for *.rep* files in current directory and allow the user to pick the one that needs to be used;
- Select a name for the output file;
- Better code structure, maybe with the use of some functions?
- Error handling;
- More flexibility related to *.rep* file structure, allowing different report styles to be used as input;
- Support for quantitative analysis reports;
- Support for some data processing
- General code optimization (?)
